\section{Universal Algebra}
\label{sec:universal-algebra}

We first develop some basic notions from universal algebra and equational
logic~\cite{birkhoffStructureAbstractAlgebras1935}.
%
Universal algebra is the abstract study of algebraic structures, which have (algebraic) operations and (universal)
equations.
%
This gives us some vocabulary and a framework to express our results in.
%
The point of view we take is the standard category-theoretic approach to universal algebra, which predates the Lawvere
theory or abstract clone point of view.
%
We keep a running example of monoids in mind, while explaining and defining the abstract concepts.
% In the language of universal algebra, such a structure is formalized by giving a signature of operations, and a
% structure being a carrier set with functions that interpret these operations. We describe such a framework for universal
% algebra in HoTT, as follows.

\subsection{Algebras}

\begin{definition}[Signature]
    A signature, denoted $\sig$, is a (dependent) pair consisting of:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item a set of operations, $\op : \Set$,
        \item an arity function for each symbol, $\ar : \op \to \Set$.
    \end{itemize}
\end{definition}

\begin{example}
    A monoid is a set with an identity element (or a nullary operation), and a binary multiplication operation.
    %
    The signature for monoids $\sigMon$ is encoded as:
    $(\Fin[2],\lambda \{0 \mapsto \Fin[0] ; 1 \mapsto \Fin[2] \})$.
    %
    Informally, the set of operations is the two-element set $\{e,\mult\}$, which is written as $\Fin[2]$,
    and the arity function picks out a (finite) set denoting the (finite) arity of each operation.
    %
    Of course, this is an example of a finitary signature,
    but in general the arity function can be any (not necessarily finite) set.
\end{example}

Every signature $\sig$ induces a signature functor on $\Set$, written $\Sig$.

\begin{definition}[Signature functor]
    \begin{align*}
        \Sig \colon \Set & \to \Set                         \\
        X                & \mapsto \dsum{o:\op}{X^{\ar(o)}} \\
        X \xto{f} Y      & \mapsto
        \dsum{o:\op}{X^{\ar(o)}}
        \xto{(o, \blank \comp f)}
        \dsum{o:\op}{Y^{\ar(o)}}
    \end{align*}
\end{definition}

\begin{example}
    The signature functor for monoids, $\SigMon$, assigns to a carrier set $X$,
    the sets of inputs for each operation.
    %
    Expanding the dependent product on $\Fin[2]$, we obtain a coproduct or disjoint union of sets:
    $\SigMon(X) \eqv X^{\Fin[0]} + X^{\Fin[2]} \eqv \unitt + (X \times X)$.
\end{example}

A $\sig$-structure is given by a carrier set, with functions interpreting each operation symbol.
%
The signature functor applied to a carrier set gives the inputs to each operation, and the output is simply a map back
to the carrier set.
%
Formally, these two pieces of data are an algebra for the $\Sig$ functor.
%
We write $\str{X}$ for a $\sig$-structure with carrier set $X$, following the model-theoretic notational convention.

\begin{definition}[Structure]
    A $\sig$-structure $\str{X}$ is an $\Sig$-algebra, that is, a pair consisting of:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item a carrier set $X$, and
        \item an algebra map $\alpha_{X}\colon \Sig(X) \to X$.
    \end{itemize}
\end{definition}

\begin{example}
    Concretely, an $\SigMon$-algebra has the type
    \[
        \alpha_{X} : \SigMon(X) \to X \eqv \unitt + (X \times X) \to X \eqv (\unitt \to X) \times (X \times X \to X)
    \]
    which is the pair of functions interpreting the two operations.
    The natural numbers with the carrier set $\Nat$,
    and the constant $0$ and the addition operation $+$ give an example of such a structure.
    %
    Similarly, with the constant $1$ and the multiplication operation $\times$, we have another monoid structure.
\end{example}

One of the advantages of an abstract framework is that we can readily leverage existing abstract machinery.
%
The notion of a homomorphism between two $\sig$-structures is a standard concept --
in the categorical framework, this is simply a map between the two $\Sig$-algebras.

\begin{definition}[Homomorphism]
    A homomorphism between two $\sig$-structures $\str{X}$ and $\str{Y}$ is a morphism of $\Sig$-algebras,
    that is, a map $f : X \to Y$ such that the following diagram commutes:
    \[
        \begin{tikzcd}
            \Sig(X) \arrow[r, "\alpha_{X}"] \arrow[d, "\Sig(f)"']
            & X \arrow[d, "f"] \\
            \Sig(Y) \arrow[r, "\alpha_{Y}"']
            & Y
        \end{tikzcd}
    \]
\end{definition}

\begin{example}
    To see concretely that this definition captures the notion of a homomorphism between two monoids ($\Sig$-algebras)
    $\str{X}$ and $\str{Y}$, we note that the top half of the diagram produces the map:
    $\unitt + (X \times X) \xto{\alpha_{X}} X \xto{f} Y$, which applies $f$ to the output of each operation,
    and the bottom half of the diagram produces the map:
    $\unitt + (X \times X) \xto{\SigMon(f)} \unitt + (Y \times Y) \xto{\alpha_{Y}} Y$,
    and the commutativity of the diagram says that these two maps are equal.
    %
    In other words, a homomorphism between $X$ and $Y$ is a map $f$ on the carrier sets that commutes with the
    interpretation of the monoid operations, or simply, preserves the monoid structure.
\end{example}

\subsection{Free Algebras}

Free algebras: For any object \( \mathfrak{Y} \) in $\sigma$-Alg, $(\blank) \circ \eta_X$ is an equivalence:
