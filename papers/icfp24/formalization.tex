\section{Formalization}
\label{sec:formalization}

In this section, we discuss some aspects of the formalization.
The rest of the paper uses informal type theoretic language, and is accessible without understanding any details of the formalization.
\vc{The formalization has a few differences from the paper and a few shortcomings due to proof engineering issues.}
\vc{If this is too short, move to a subsection of~\cref{sec:discussion}}.
