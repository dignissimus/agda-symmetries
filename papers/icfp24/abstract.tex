Sorting algorithms are among the most fundamental in computing science, and are frequently studied in relation to functional programming. There have been many investigations of the correctness of sorting algorithms in terms of total orders and category theory. We provide a new perspective on this topic by approaching it via universal algebra, viewing a sorting algorithm as a section (right inverse) to a surjective function from a free monoid to a free commutative monoid. Our main contribution is a new axiomatization of correct sorting algorithms, using two axioms that are not expressed in terms of a pre-existing total order. Instead, the total order can be recovered from the definition of an algorithm that satisfies the axioms. Our theory is formalized in Cubical Agda.
