Sorting algorithms are one of the most common algorithms in functional programming.
Previous works have investigated the correctness of sorting algorithms in terms of
total orders and category theory. 

We provide another perspective on the correctness of sorting algorithms with
universal algebra by understanding it in terms of surjective functions from
free monoids to free commutative monoids, leveraging the power of cubical
type theory to implement theses ideas.
