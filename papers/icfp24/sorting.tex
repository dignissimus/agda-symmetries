\section{Total orders and Sorting}
\label{sec:sorting}

Now consider the canonical map $q : \LL(A) \to \MM(A)$ given by $\ext{\eta_A}$. $q$ would be a surjective
function which "forgets" the order on a free monoid and turns it into a free commutative monoid.
The axiom of choice says every surjection $f$ has a section $s$ such that $\forall x.\, f(s(x)) = x$.

    }

\end{figure}

Since free commutative monoid is the quotient of free monoid by a permutation relation
(which we have proven in~\ref{cmon:qfreemon}), a section $s$ to $q$ would pick a canonical representation
out of the equivalence class generated by permutation.
Using $\SList$ as an example, $s(x :: y :: xs) = s(y :: x :: xs)$ for any $x, y : A$ and $xs : \SList(A)$,
and since it must also respect $\forall xs.\,q(s(xs)) = xs$, $s$ must preserve all content of $xs$,
in other words, it cannot be a trivial function such as $\lambda\,xs. []$.
$s$ must therefore
somehow impose an order on $A$ such that it can be invariant to permutations, turning an unordered list of $A$
into an ordered list of $A$. Axiom of choice giving us a section $s$ to $q$ "for free" is analagous to how
AC implies the well-ordering theorem, which states every set can be well-ordered. However, we want to study
how constructively such as a section can be defined, and the implications of its existence on how $A$
can be ordered or sorted.

We can now study sort functions as sections and their relationship with total orders.
First, we recall the axioms of total order are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item reflexivity: $x \leq x$
    \item transitivity: if $x \leq y$ and $y \leq z$, then $x \leq z$
    \item antisymmetry: if $x \leq y$ and $y \leq x$, then $x = y$
    \item totality: forall $x$ and $y$, we have merely either $x \leq y$ or $y \leq x$ 
\end{itemize}

In the context of this paper, we also want to make a distinction between "decidable total order"
and just "total order". A decidable total order should also satisfy
\begin{itemize}
    \item decidability: forall $x$ and $y$, we have either $x \leq y$ or $\neg(x \leq y)$ 
\end{itemize}

This is a stronger version of the totality axiom, where with totality we have 
either $x \leq y$ or $y \leq x$ merely as a proposition, but decidability allows us to actually
compute if $x \leq y$ is true.

\begin{proposition}
Assume there is a decidable total order on $A$. There is a sort function $s: \MM(A) \to \LL(A)$
which constructs a section to $q : \LL(A) \twoheadrightarrow \MM(A)$
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
We can easily construct such a section by any sorting algorithm. In our formalization we chose
insertion sort $\SList(A) \to \List(A)$ due to its inductive properties and simple definition.
However, if we want to define other sorting algorithms, e.g. merge-sort,
other representations such as $\Bag \to \Array$ would be more suitable as we have explained in~\ref{bag:rep}.
It is easy to see how this
proposition holds: $q(s(xs))$ orders an unordered list $xs$ by $s$, and re-discard the order again by
$q$, the act of imposing then forgetting an order on $xs$ does nothing, therefore $q(s(xs)) = xs$ holds.
\end{proof}


\subsection{Order from section}
At this point one may ask if we can construct a section from order, can we construct an order from section?
Indeed, just by the virtue of $s$ being a section, we can almost construct a relation that satisfies
all axioms of total order except transitivity.
We use $\{x,y,\dots\}$ to denote $\eta_A(x) \otimes \eta_A(y) \otimes \dots : \MM(A)$,
and $[x, y, \dots]$ to denote $\eta_A(x) \otimes \eta_A(y) \otimes \dots : \LL(A)$,
or $x :: xs$ to denote $\eta_A(x) \otimes xs : \LL(A)$.

\begin{definition}
Given a section $s$, we define $\term{least}(xs) := \term{head}(s(xs))$.
Further, we define $x \preccurlyeq y := \term{least}(\{x, y\}) = x$. 
\end{definition}

Conceptually, $\term{least}$ sorts $xs$ by $s$, and pick the first element of the sorted list.
With this we can prove the following properties of $\preccurlyeq$.

\begin{proposition}
    $\preccurlyeq$ is decidable iff $A$ has decidable equality.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proposition}
$\preccurlyeq$ is reflexive, antisymmetric, and total.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
For all $x$, $\term{least}(\{x, x\})$ must be $x$, therefore $x \preccurlyeq x$, giving reflexivity.
For all $x$ and $y$, given $x \preccurlyeq y$ and $y \preccurlyeq x$,
we have $\term{least}(\{x, y\}) = x$ and $\term{least}(\{y, x\}) = y$.
Since $\{x, y\} = \{y, x\}$, $\term{least}(\{x, y\}) = \term{least}(\{y, x\})$,
therefore we have $x = y$, giving antisymmetry.
For all $x$ and $y$, $\term{least}(\{x, y\})$ is merely either $x$ or $y$,
therefore we have merely either $x \preccurlyeq y$ or $y \preccurlyeq x$, giving totality.
\end{proof}

\begin{proposition}
$\preccurlyeq$ is not necessarily transitive.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
We give a counter-example of $s$ that would violate transitivity.
Consider this section $s : \SList(\Nat) \to \List(\Nat)$, we can define a sort function
$\term{sort} : \SList(\Nat) \to \List(\Nat)$ which sorts $\SList(\Nat)$ ascendingly. We can use $\term{sort}$
to construct $s$.
\begin{align*}
    s(xs) &= \begin{cases}
        \term{sort}(xs) & \text{if $\term{length}(xs)$ is odd} \\        
        \term{reverse}(\term{sort}(xs)) & \text{otherwise}
    \end{cases}\\
    s([2,3,1,4]) &= [4,3,2,1]\\
    s([2,3,1]) &= [1,2,3]
\end{align*}
\end{proof}

As we can see, we need more constraint on $s$ to prove $\preccurlyeq$ is transitive.
We first give some definitions:
\begin{definition}
    Given a list $xs : \LL(A)$, we say $xs$ is in the image of s $\issorted(xs)$ if there merely exists
    a $ys : \MM(A)$ such that $s(ys) = xs$.
\end{definition}

If $s$ is a sort function, then the image of $s$ would be the set of sorted list, therefore
$\issorted(xs)$ would imply $xs$ is a sorted list.

\begin{proposition}\label{sort:sort-to-order}
    $x \preccurlyeq y$ iff $\issorted([x, y])$.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proposition}
    If $A$ has a total order $\leq$, insertion sort $\MM(A) \to \LL(A)$ defined with $\leq$
    satisfies $\isheadleast$.
\end{proposition}

\noindent
We then introduce our first axiom of sorting:
\begin{definition}\label{sort:head-least}
    A section $s$ to $q$ satisfies $\isheadleast$ iff
    $\forall x\, y\, xs.\, \issorted(x :: xs) \land y \in (x :: xs) \to \issorted([x,y])$.
\end{definition}
Here we use the definition of $\in$ from~\ref{comb:member}. Informally,
if we assume $s$ is a sort function, this states if
$x$ is the smallest element of a sorted list $ys$, then for any element $y \in ys$,
$[x, y]$ should be a sorted list. This ensures that $s$ would correctly sort 2-element lists.

\begin{proposition}
    Assuming $s$ satisfies $\isheadleast$, $\preccurlyeq$ is transitive.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
    We use a weaker version of the axiom where $x :: xs$ is fixed to have length of 3.
    We are given $x \preccurlyeq y$ and $y \preccurlyeq z$, we want to show $x \preccurlyeq z$.
    Consider the 3-element $\{x,y,z\} : \MM(A)$. Let $u$ be $\term{least}(\{x,y,z\})$,
    by~\ref{sort:head-least} and~\ref{sort:sort-to-order},
    we have $u \preccurlyeq x \land u \preccurlyeq y \land u \preccurlyeq z$.
    Since $u \in \{x,y,z\}$, $u$ must be one of the element. We prove transitivity by case splitting.
    If $u = x$ we have $x \preccurlyeq z$. If $u = y$ we have $y \preccurlyeq x$, and since
    $x \preccurlyeq y$ and $y \preccurlyeq z$ by assumption,
    we have $x = y$ by antisymmetry and then we have $x \preccurlyeq z$ by substitution.
    Finally, if $u = z$, we have $z \preccurlyeq y$, and since
    $y \preccurlyeq z$ and $x \preccurlyeq y$ by assumption,
    we have $z = y$ by antisymmetry and then we have $x \preccurlyeq z$ by substitution.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Embedding of order into sections}

We have shown that a section $s$ that satisfies $\isheadleast$ would imply a total order
$x \preccurlyeq y := \term{least}(\{x, y\}) = x$,
and a total order $\leq$ would imply a section that satisfies $\isheadleast$ which can
be constructed by insertion sort by $\leq$. Now, can we construct a full equivalence
between sections $\MM(A) \to \LL(A)$ that satisfy $\isheadleast$ and total orders on $A$?

\begin{proposition}\label{sort:o2s2o}
    Assume $A$ has a decidable total order $\leq$, we can construct a section $s$ that
    satisfies $\isheadleast$, such that $\preccurlyeq$ constructed from $s$ is equivalent
    to $\leq$.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
    Let $\term{sort} : \MM(A) \to \LL(A)$ be insertion sort defined on $A$ by $\leq$.
    We define $\term{sort}$ to be our section $s$ which satisfy $\isheadleast$.
    It is trivial to see $\issortedany_{\term{sort}}([x, y])$ iff $x \leq y$ by the definition
    of insertion sort. By~\ref{sort:sort-to-order} we can see $x \preccurlyeq y$ iff $x \leq y$.
    We now have a total order $x \preccurlyeq y$ equivalent to $x \leq y$.

    To show $x \preccurlyeq y$ is also decidable, we need to show $A$ has decidable equality.
    Since $\leq$ is decidable, we can use it to show $A$ has decidable equality as follow:
    We decide if $x \leq y$ and $y \leq x$ and perform case splitting:

    Case $x \leq y$ and $y \leq x$: by antisymmetry, $x = y$.
    
    Case $\neg(x \leq y)$ and $y \leq x$: if $x = y$, then $x \leq y$,
    leading to contradiction by $\neg(x \leq y)$. Therefore $x \neq y$.
    
    Case $x \leq y$ and $\neg(y \leq x)$: Similar logic as above.

    Case $\neg(x \leq y)$ and $\neg(y \leq x)$: by totality we must have either
    $x \leq y$ or $y \leq x$, therefore contradiction, this case would never occur.
\end{proof}

We now have one side of the isomorphism, and showed the set of decidable total order of $A$
can be embedded into the set of sections $s$ that satisfy $\isheadleast$.

\subsection{Equivalence of order and sections}
To upgrade the embedding into an isomorphism, all that is left
is to show we can turn a section satisfying $\isheadleast$ to a total order $\preccurlyeq$, and construct the
same section back from $\preccurlyeq$. Unfortunately, this is not the case.

\begin{proposition}
    Assume $A$ is a set with different elements, i.e. $\exists x, y: A.\,x \neq y$,
    we cannot construct a full equivalence between sections that satisfy $\isheadleast$
    and total orders on $A$.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
    We give a counter-example of $s$ that satisfy $\isheadleast$ but is not a sort function.
    Consider the insertion sort function $\term{sort} : \MM(\Nat) \to \LL(\Nat)$
    parameterized by $\leq$:
    \begin{align*}
    \term{reverseTail}([]) & = [] \\
    \term{reverseTail}(x :: xs) & = x :: \term{reverse}(xs) \\
    s(xs) & = \term{reverseTail}(\term{sort}(xs)) \\
    s(\{2,3,1,4\}) & = [1,4,3,2] \\
    s(\{2,3,1\}) & = [1, 3, 2] \\
    s(\{2,3\}) & = [2, 3] \\
    \end{align*}
    By~\ref{sort:o2s2o} we can use $\term{sort}$ to construct $\preccurlyeq$ which would be
    equivalent to $\leq$. However, the $\preccurlyeq$ constructed by $s$ would also be equivalent
    to $\leq$. This is because $s$ sorts 2-element list correctly, despite $s \neq \term{sort}$.
    Since two different sections satisfying $\isheadleast$ maps to the same total order,
    there cannot be a full equivalence.
\end{proof}

As we can see, we need more constraint to prove a full equivalence.
We introduce our second axiom of sorting:
\begin{definition}
    A section $s$ to $q$ satisfies $\istailsort$ iff
    $\forall x\,xs.\,\issorted(x :: xs) \to \issorted(xs)$.
\end{definition}

To prove that this axiom is correct, we need to show a section $s$ satisfying
$\isheadleast$ and $\istailsort$ would be equal to insertion sort parameterized by
the $\preccurlyeq$ constructed from $s$. To prove this, we introduce an inductive data type
for a witness of sorted lists, taken from~\cite{appelVerifiedFunctionalAlgorithms2023}.

\begin{code}
data Sorted ($\leq$ : A -> A -> UU) : List A -> UU where
  sorted-nil : Sorted []
  sorted-one : forall x -> Sorted [ x ]
  sorted-cons : forall x y zs -> x $\leq$ y -> Sorted (y :: zs) -> Sorted (x :: y :: zs)
\end{code}

\begin{proposition}
    Given an order $\leq$, for any $xs, ys : \LL(A)$,
    $q(xs) = q(ys) \land \term{Sorted}_{\leq}(xs) \land \term{Sorted}_{\leq}(ys) \to xs = ys$.
\end{proposition}

Informally, this states if $xs$ and $ys$ have the same elements, i.e. they belong to the same
equivalence class generated by permutation, and if they are both sorted by $\leq$, then they would be the same.

\begin{corollary}\label{sort:sort-uniq}
    Given an order $\leq$,
    if a section $s$ always produces sorted list, i.e. $\forall xs.\,\term{Sorted}_{\leq}(s(xs))$,
    $s$ is equal to insertion sort by $\leq$.
\end{corollary}
It is trivial to see how insertion sort by $\leq$ would always produce lists that satisfy
$\term{Sorted}_{\leq}$. Therefore, any functions that also always produce lists that satisfy
$\term{Sorted}_{\leq}$ would equal to insertion sort by function extensionality.

We can now prove the full equivalence:
\begin{proposition}\label{sort:s2o2s}
Assume $A$ has decidable equality and given a section $s$ that satisfies $\isheadleast$ and $\istailsort$, 
we can construct a section $t$ that also satisfies $\isheadleast$ and $\istailsort$, such that $s = t$.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
    From $s$ we can construct a decidable total order $\preccurlyeq$ since $s$ satisfies
    $\isheadleast$ and $A$ has decidable equality by assumption.
    We construct $t$ as insertion sort parameterized by $\preccurlyeq$ constructed from $s$.
    By~\ref{sort:sort-uniq} it remains to show $\forall xs.\,\term{Sorted}_{\preccurlyeq}(s(xs))$.
    For lists of length 0 and 1 this is trivial. For further cases we need to prove by induction:
    given a $xs : \MM(A)$ of length $\geq 2$, let $s(xs) = x :: y :: ys$. We need to show
    $x \preccurlyeq y \land \term{Sorted}_{\preccurlyeq}(y :: ys)$ to construct
    $\term{Sorted}_{\preccurlyeq}(x :: y :: ys)$.
    By $\isheadleast$ we have $x \preccurlyeq y$, and by $\istailsort$ we an
    inductively $\term{Sorted}_{\preccurlyeq}(y :: ys)$.
    Therefore, $s = t$.
\end{proof}

We can now state our main theorem: a well-behaved section $s : \MM(A) \to \LL(A)$ to
the canonical map $q : \LL(A) \to \MM(A)$ should satisfy the following two axioms,
which axiomatizes a correct sorting algorithm.
\begin{definition}
    \leavevmode
    \begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
        \item $\isheadleast$: any 2-element list can be correctly sorted\\
              \(
              \forall x \: y \: xs. \issorted(x :: xs) \land y \in (x :: xs) \to \issorted(x :: y :: [])
              \),
        \item $\istailsort$: the first axiom can be coherently lifted to 2+-element list\\
              \(
              \forall x \: xs. \issorted(x :: xs) \to \issorted(xs)
              \).
    \end{itemize}
\end{definition}
\begin{theorem}\label{sort:main}
    Let $\term{DecTotOrd}(A)$ be the set of decidable total orders on $A$,
    $\term{Sort}(A)$ be the set of correct sorting functions with carrier set $A$,
    and $\term{isDiscrete}(A)$ be a predicate which states $A$ has decidable equality.
    We have the function $o2s \colon \term{DecTotOrd}(A) \to \term{Sort}(A) \times \term{isDiscrete}(A)$
    is an equivalence.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
    By~\ref{sort:o2s2o} we show a decidable total order on $A$ implies a sort function
    on $A$ and that $A$ has decidable equality.
    By~\ref{sort:s2o2s} we show a sort function on $A$ assuming $A$ has decidable equality
    implies a decidable total order on $A$.
\end{proof}
