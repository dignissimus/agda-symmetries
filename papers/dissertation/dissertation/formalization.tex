\label{sec:formalization}

In this section, we discuss some aspects of the formalization.
The paper uses informal type theoretic language,
and is accessible without understanding any details of the formalization.
However, the formalization is done in Cubical Agda, which has a few differences and a few
shortcomings due to proof engineering issues.

For simplicity we omitted type levels in the paper, but our formalization constructions
are generalized to all type-levels.
The free algebra framework in the formalization is
parameterized by any h-levels, but it currently only works with sets.
We also note the axioms of sorting in the formalization is named differently,
$\issorted$ is $\term{is-sorted}$
$\isheadleast$ is $\term{is-head-least}$, and
$\istailsort$ is $\term{is-tail-sort}$.
We give a table of the Agda file names and their corresponding sections
in the paper ($\term{Cubical.Structures}$ is shortened to $\term{CS}$).
